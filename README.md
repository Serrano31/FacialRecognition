## What is this?
This study focuses on developing and evaluating a facial recognition system using the Olivetti Faces dataset. It utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data dimensionality and highlight key facial features. Various models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and EigenFaces, are tested for classification. Results indicate that the EigenFaces algorithm, enhanced with data augmentation techniques, provides the highest accuracy, significantly improving facial identification performance. The system is intended for integration into a robot ([see the robotics project here](https://github.com/guillecade22/ShotBot)) being developed for a Robotics course.

The project aims to create an efficient and accurate facial recognition system by combining the diverse Olivetti Faces dataset, PCA, and various classifiers. This will enhance understanding of facial recognition systems and their potential applications in different contexts. For a detailed performance analysis, refer to the [paper](paper.pdf).
